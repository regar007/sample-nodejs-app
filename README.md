# sample-nodejs-app

This project is simplest setup of a NodeJs application on your system. 

## Basic setup: terminal

Install nodejs and npm

Navigate to the App directory

install dependencies from package.json ``` $ npm install ```

start app ``` $ node server.js ``` 

## live monitoring of app

``` $ npm install -g nodemon ```
